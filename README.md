### Run task [optional]
This website using [Gulp.js](https://gulpjs.com/) to manage the run task like minify the JS and the CSS files. The dependencies that are using on the `package.json`:

```
"devDependencies": {
  "gulp": "^4.0.0",
  "gulp-minify": "^3.1.0",
  "gulp-clean-css": "^4.0.0",
  "gulp-rename": "^1.4.0"
}
```

In the App folder are the development files to work. Gulp will work the App folder and publish them minified in the Public folder. `index.html` calls these public files to show only minified files.

Run `gulp` command in your project directory.

If you need install it first, this is a [Gulp quick Start](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start).
